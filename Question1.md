## Question 1

Write a program that, given a string `s` as input, prints the string obtained from removing all duplicate characters from `s` (that is, retain only the first occurrence of each character). The characters should appear in the output in the same order as they appear in `s`.

Note: `str.charAt(arg)`: returns the character present at index `arg` in the string `str`.

### Sample input 1:
abababa

### Output:
ab
